* Will be part of the Pronoia Health & Wellness Marketplace.


* The Workbook Factory is a web3 dApp (or web2?) that allows authors to create interactive, online workbooks; 
  share those workbooks with potential clients; 
  and ultimately sell access to the workbook (similar to Steam's marketplace). 
  This is a two sided marketplace for creators and consumers of workbooks.
  (What exactly is a Workbook?) 


* What makes it web3 is our aim to leverage Decentralized Identification (DID), 
  possibly using IPFS (the interplanetary file system), 
  and potentially turning workbooks into fungible or non-fungible tokens 
  in order to create derivative works that remunerate and protect the creator of origin.


* Will be using Ethereum or Algorand.


================================================================

Questions:

    - Unclear as to whether we will we be working with web2 or web3.

    - Unclear what exactly a "Workbook" is.

    - What language does the author want this product to be written in?


================================================================

Pros of this project:

    - Possible experience with web3 and NFT's.


Cons of this project:

    - Will likely be very difficult as no one has experience with web3.
