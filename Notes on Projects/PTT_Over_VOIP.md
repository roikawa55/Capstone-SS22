# PTT Over VOIP

---

- Write an android app that can speak PTT (Like walkie talkie) over the VOIP protocol (Like zoom meetings, etc)
- This involves creating a server, and an app that can talk to the server
- The sponsor wants the protocol to work wit P2P as well as client server networks

### Pros

---

- Learn android development technologies, like Kotlin and Java
- Learn how to work with different kinds of networks
- Create a project that will be heavily used in industry (At least by this company)

### Cons

---

- Might not be a very large project, so we could run out of things to do quickly
