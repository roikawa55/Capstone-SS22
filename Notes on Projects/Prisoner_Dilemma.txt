* Create a simulation of a game theory dilemma that explores the ethical dimensions of the process. 
    - Most simulations of the Prisoner's Dilemma look at different possible strategies 
      but do not explore the influence of the opinion of one player over others. 
    - Things will be different in a simulation that allows the prisoners to educate 
      each other prior to the arrest, and, most importantly, a simulation that would 
      take into consideration the value each of the prisoners puts on doing the right thing.


* Author would like to explore other options: change from circle to grid. 
  Create "neighborhoods," allow immigration, introduce education, or ethical system. 
  The implication for trust across borders during a climate crisis or a pandemic are serious. 
  Imagine if we could educate a million students on the globe with this simulation, 
  or one of its future descendantsâ€¦
