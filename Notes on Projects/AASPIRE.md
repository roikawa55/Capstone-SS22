# AASPIRE

- Platform for helping people with autism navigate the healthcare system
- Priority is AHAT, a survey tool for autistic patients to fill out about their healthcare experience
- The current tool is horrendously outdated
- They want AHAT rebuilt as an phone app.
    - They want nontechnical people to be able to update content in the app

### Tech Stack

- LAMP
    - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
    - Very old, from 2008
- Perl
- LaTeX

---

- Pros
    - Learn about accessability which is just going to get more important
    - Learn about implementing healthcare data protection law compliant software
    - Android/IPhone app dev
- Cons
    - Lots of work, it sounds like the project could have a very large scale, since they eventually want the entire AASPIRE suite functionality in the App
    - Developing for two different hardware devices that have different architecture could mean two entirely different codebases
        - We could use a framework like Flutter to make this less painful

### Questions

---

- Do they want both an android and IPhone app?
